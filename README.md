# Intent-Detection
The dataset includes 7 intents and 14 thousand samples. The model takes the raw texts which are tokenized and vectorized to feed into the pre-trained model. Overall, 98 % accuracy is achieved in detecting the intents from the trained model.

• Tensorflow 2.0 is used.
• BERT-base model is used with 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads.
• bert-for-tf2 package is used to train.
